## From SRS to Software Architecture: Do LLMs do real creative work or merely imitate?

Paper submitted to ICSA 2026. The data in this repository is shared to preserve anonymity for the paper review process. A web app is also available and will be released with the paper, if accepted.

### Description

Datasets from experimenting with various LLMs for creating architectures (client-server, 3-tier, MVC, microservices) from textual descriptions of requirements (FR & NFR, SRS) with parameters relating to RAG materials and RAG embedding models.

### Experiments

- Dummy Coordinate Conversion (DCC): A very simple app to convert coordinates from polar to cartesian and vice versa. Architectures investigated: client-server, 3-tier and MVC.
- MyCharts: A SaaS app allowing you to create charts from textual descriptions and data. Architectures investigated: client-server, 3-tier, MVC and microservices.
