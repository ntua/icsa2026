Question:
Task Description: You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

The requirements for the software we want you to design decribed below:
Functional Requirements  

1. Authenticate users via Google accounts.  
2. Allow download of CSV templates for 3 supported chart types (Basic line, Line with annotations, Basic column).  
3. Upload CSV file with the user data for chart generation.
4. Validate uploaded CSV files against the template structure, data types, and mandatory data existence.  
5. Generate charts with data from the CSV file uploaded by the user, using Highcharts.  
6. Save charts to the server in PDF, PNG, SVG, and HTML formats.  
7. Display a dashboard with the history of user-generated charts, including chart previews.  
8. Download selected chart type.
9. Charge quotas for chart creation.  
10. Allow users to delete or download charts. 
11. Sell quotas and receive payment by a payment gateway
12. Maintain user profiles containing the following data: Name (from Google account), profile picture (from Google account), email (from Google account), remaining quota, account creation timestamp, last login timestamp.  
13. Display user's profile info, including remaining quotas.

Non-Functional Requirements

Performance  
- Chart generation completes within **3 seconds**.  
Usability  
- Intuitive UI with guided workflows (e.g., tooltips, validation hints) to assist non-technical users.  
Security  
- SSL encryption: Data transmitted ove the internet is encrypted using SSL.  
Availability    
- The service should be available 90% of the time on a daily basis.
- The system should prioritize **Availability over Consistency** during network partitioning.  
- While in network partitioning, although temporary data inconsistencies may occur, as many as possible services should remain fully operational. 
Scalability  
- Support 1,000 concurrent users.

The demanded Architecture is: Microservices

Important guidelines for designing proper microservices architecture: 

1. Functional Alignment & Responsibility Distribution
Focus:
 Ensure that each microservice maps to a bounded context and implements a focused set of functionalities. The union of the functionalities of each microservice should be the entire set of functional requirements.

2. Coupling & Deployment Independence
Focus:
 Ensure that microservices are loosely coupled and independently deployable

3. Cohesion
Focus:
 Ensure high cohesion meaning that more than one microservice needs to be involved in the completion of each use case.

4. Data Management
Focus:
Ensure that each service is responsible for managing specific data elements without using shared databases.

5. Data Consistency
Focus:
 Ensure that operations to achieve eventual consistency of data states among different microservices are included.

6. Communication & Flow Control
Focus:
 Ensure that service coordination is done using choreography or orchestration mechanisms. API gateways and/or messaging (pub-sub) services should be used to implement flow control.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Focus:
 Ensure that the design satisfies all problem-specific non-functional requirements.


Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:

The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
All associations (especially operation calls for service offerings, service dependencies) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented.
Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

Classify each operation into one of the following groups (by commenting next to the operation in the PlantUML):

Functional requirement—business logic operation
Data management operation
Data consistency operation
Flow control operation

Additionally, calculate the following characteristics of the architecture:

General characteristics:
- SI: Counts that services do not carry persistent state across requests and divides with the total number of services. SI = (# of stateless services) / |Total number of services|
- DOC (Data Ownership Count): Counts the services that manage a dedicated data store and divides with the total number of services. DOC = (# of services that are linked to a dedicated data store) / |Total Number of services|
- SST (Service Support for Transactions): Counts the services that have at least one operation classified as "Data consistency operation" and divides with the total number of services. SST(S) = (# of transaction-aware services) / |Total Amount of services|.

Characteristics per service:
    - SIC (Service Interface Count): Counts the interfaces of service S.
    - AIS = Number of distinct consumers of service S
    - ADS = Number of distinct services called by S

Characteristics per use case:
    - SC: Set of services involved for the completion of one use case. SC = {(Set of microservices involved per use case) MS SET}

Display the characteristics described above, in a JSON object with the following format:
{
    "SI": "",
    "DOC": "",
    "SST": "",
    "services": [
        {
            "service_name": "",

            "SIC": "",
            "AIS(in)": "",
            "ADS(out)": "",
        },
    ],
    "use_cases": [
        {
            "use_case_name": "",
            "SC": "",
        },

            "use_case_name": "",
            "SC": "",
        },
    ],        
}

        },
        {

        }
    ]
}
```

Here are the calculations for the characteristics:

* SI (Statelessness Index): 5 out of 7 services do not carry persistent state, so SI = 5/7 ≈ 0.71.
* DOC (Data Ownership Coefficient): 4 out of 7 services own data, so DOC = 4/7 ≈ 0.57.
* SST (Service Structure Type): 3 out of 7 services have a complex structure with multiple classes and relationships, so SST = 3/7 ≈ 0.43.

The SIC (Service Interface Complexity) values are based on the number of public methods in each service class. The AIS(in) and ADS(out) values represent the number of incoming and outgoing dependencies for each service, respectively.
