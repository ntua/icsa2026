Question:
Task Description: You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

The requirements for the software we want you to design are in the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) here: # Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Dummy Coordinate Converter Application

---

## 1. [Introduction](Introduction)

### 1.1 Introduction: Purpose of the Software

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is an application that manages coordinate groups in Cartesian and Polar formats. The app allows users to input, convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups.

### 1.2 Interfaces

#### 1.2.1 User Interfaces

The user interacts with the application via a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Java and the Swing framework. This interface includes all the necessary buttons and controls to implement the use cases outlined below.

---

### 2. [References - Glossary](Glossary)

- **Cartesian Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using two values: 𝑥 (horizontal position) and 𝑦 (vertical position). Example: (x, y).

- **Polar Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using a radius (𝑟) and an angle (𝜃), measured from the origin. Example: (𝑟, 𝜃).

- **Coordinate Group:**
A collection of coordinates that includes both Cartesian and Polar representations.

### 3.1 Use Cases

The user should be able to perform the following actions: create a coordinate group, modify a coordinate group, delete a coordinate group, view all coordinate groups, and view a specific coordinate group selected by its label. These use cases are illustrated in the use case diagram provided below. Additionally, each use case is elaborated in detail in the subsequent sections.

### 3.2 Data Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Data Organization Organization Requirements

The database must be designed to store the following attributes for each coordinate group:
- Auto-generated unique primary key (integer)
- Timestamp (automatically assigned the date and time of group creation)
- Unique user-defined label for identification
- Coordinates in Polar format (r, θ)
- Coordinates in Cartesian format (x,y)

The following conceptual Entity Relationship Diagram describes the high-level design of the database. 

```plantuml
@startchen
entity CoordinateGroup {
  ID
  Timestamp
  Label
  Polar Coordinates
  Cartesian Coordinates
}
@endchen
```

#### 3.2.2 Data Access Requirements

The system must be designed to store all data in a MySQL database. The application will connect to the database using a TCP/IP connection.

The demanded Architecture is: MVC(Model-View-Controller)

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:

The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented.
Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.
