### 2. [References - Glossary](Glossary)

- **Cartesian Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using two values: 𝑥 (horizontal position) and 𝑦 (vertical position). Example: (x, y).

- **Polar Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using a radius (𝑟) and an angle (𝜃), measured from the origin. Example: (𝑟, 𝜃).

- **Coordinate Group:**
A collection of coordinates that includes both Cartesian and Polar representations.

### 3.2 Data Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Data Organization Organization Requirements

The database must be designed to store the following attributes for each coordinate group:
- Auto-generated unique primary key (integer)
- Timestamp (automatically assigned the date and time of group creation)
- Unique user-defined label for identification
- Coordinates in Polar format (r, θ)
- Coordinates in Cartesian format (x,y)

The following conceptual Entity Relationship Diagram describes the high-level design of the database. 

```plantuml
@startchen
entity CoordinateGroup {
  ID
  Timestamp
  Label
  Polar Coordinates
  Cartesian Coordinates
}
@endchen
```

#### 3.2.2 Data Access Requirements

The system must be designed to store all data in a MySQL database. The application will connect to the database using a TCP/IP connection.

The demanded Architecture is: Three-Tier

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:

The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented.
Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to create a class diagram based on the provided use cases and data requirements. Let me start by understanding what each part entails.

First, the system is divided into three tiers: Presentation, Application, and Data Access. Each tier has its own responsibilities. The Presentation layer handles user interactions, like buttons and displays. The Application layer manages the business logic, such as retrieving or deleting coordinate groups. The Data Access layer deals with database operations.

Looking at the use cases:

1. **View All Coordinate Groups**: This involves fetching all data from the database and displaying it.
2. **View by Label**: Filters data based on a label and displays the results.
3. **Delete Coordinate Group**: Removes a selected group from the database.

The data requirements mention that each coordinate group has an ID, timestamp, label, polar coordinates (r, θ), and Cartesian coordinates (x,y). The database uses MySQL with a TCP/IP connection.

I think I need to define classes for each layer. In the Presentation layer, maybe a class like CoordinateGroupUI that handles user inputs and displays data. It would interact with the Application layer's Coordinator class, which manages the business logic.

For the Data Access layer, a class like CoordinateGroupDAO (Data Access Object) would handle database operations—retrieving, filtering, deleting data. This class should have methods corresponding to each use case.

The CoordinateGroup class itself would encapsulate the data attributes and possibly some conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates.

I need to ensure that dependencies are managed correctly. The UI shouldn't directly interact with the database; it goes through the Coordinator. Similarly, the Coordinator uses the DAO for database operations without knowing the specifics.

In terms of associations:

- CoordinateGroupUI depends on Coordinator.
- Coordinator depends on CoordinateGroupDAO and might use or create CoordinateGroup objects.
- CoordinateGroupDAO obviously depends on the CoordinateGroup since it handles its data storage.

I should also consider if there are any composition or aggregation relationships. For example, the DAO is part of the Data Access tier but doesn't own the data—it just accesses it.

Putting this together, I'll structure the PlantUML diagram with packages for each layer and define the classes within them, showing their attributes and methods as per the use cases.
</think>

To address the requirements outlined in Section 3.1 and 3.2, we can design a class diagram that aligns with the Three-Tier architecture and encapsulates all necessary functionality. Below is the PlantUML code to generate this class diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Presentation Layer" {
    class CoordinateGroupUI {
        - Button viewAllButton
        - Button findByLabelButton
        - Button deleteButton
        - TextField labelField
        - List<CoordinateGroup> coordinateList

        + void initView()
        + void refreshList()
        + void showEmptyListMessage()
    }
}

package "Application Layer" {
    class CoordinateGroupCoordinator {
        - CoordinateGroupDAO dao
        - CoordinateGroupUI ui

        + List<CoordinateGroup> getAllCoordinateGroups()
        + List<CoordinateGroup> getCoordinateGroupsByLabel(String label)
        + void deleteCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
    }
}

package "Data Access Layer" {
    class CoordinateGroupDAO {
        - Connection dbConnection
        - ResultSet resultSet

        + List<CoordinateGroup> findAllCoordinateGroups()
        + List<CoordinateGroup> findCoordinateGroupsByLabel(String label)
        + void deleteCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
    }
}

package "Domain Model" {
    class CoordinateGroup {
        - Integer id
        - Date timestamp
        - String label
        - Double r
        - Double theta
        - Double x
        - Double y

        + CoordinateGroup(Integer id, Date timestamp, String label, Double r, Double theta, Double x, Double y)
    }
}

' Associations
CoordinateGroupUI --> CoordinateGroupCoordinator : Uses
CoordinateGroupCoordinator --> CoordinateGroupDAO : Delegates to
CoordinateGroupDAO --> CoordinateGroup : Persists/Retrieves
@enduml
```

### Explanation

#### Packages and Layers
The class diagram is organized into four packages:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions.
- **Application Layer**: Manages business logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Encapsulates database operations.
- **Domain Model**: Represents the data structure.

#### Class Descriptions

1. **CoordinateGroupUI** (Presentation Layer)
   - Attributes: UI components like buttons, text fields, and a list to display coordinate groups.
   - Methods: Initialize the view, refresh the displayed list, show messages when the list is empty.

2. **CoordinateGroupCoordinator** (Application Layer)
   - Attributes: References to DAO and UI classes.
   - Methods: Coordinates interactions between UI and DAO, such as fetching all groups or filtering by label.

3. **CoordinateGroupDAO** (Data Access Layer)
   - Attributes: Database connection and result set handling.
   - Methods: CRUD operations for coordinate groups—fetching, filtering, deleting.

4. **CoordinateGroup** (Domain Model)
   - Attributes: Fields like id, timestamp, label, polar coordinates (r, θ), Cartesian coordinates (x,y).
   - Constructor: Initializes a CoordinateGroup object with all necessary data.

#### Relationships
- The UI depends on the Coordinator to perform actions.
- The Coordinator delegates database operations to the DAO.
- The DAO interacts with the domain model to persist and retrieve data.

This structure ensures separation of concerns, making the system modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.
