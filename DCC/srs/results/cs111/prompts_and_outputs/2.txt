Question:
Task Description: You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

The requirements for the software we want you to design are in the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) here: # Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Dummy Coordinate Converter Application

---

## 1. [Introduction](Introduction)

### 1.1 Introduction: Purpose of the Software

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is an application that manages coordinate groups in Cartesian and Polar formats. The app allows users to input, convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups.

### 1.2 Interfaces

#### 1.2.1 User Interfaces

The user interacts with the application via a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Java and the Swing framework. This interface includes all the necessary buttons and controls to implement the use cases outlined below.

---

### 2. [References - Glossary](Glossary)

- **Cartesian Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using two values: 𝑥 (horizontal position) and 𝑦 (vertical position). Example: (x, y).

- **Polar Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using a radius (𝑟) and an angle (𝜃), measured from the origin. Example: (𝑟, 𝜃).

- **Coordinate Group:**
A collection of coordinates that includes both Cartesian and Polar representations.

## 3. Software Requirements Specifications

### 3.1 Use Cases

The user should be able to perform the following actions: create a coordinate group, modify a coordinate group, delete a coordinate group, view all coordinate groups, and view a specific coordinate group selected by its label. These use cases are illustrated in the use case diagram provided below. Additionally, each use case is elaborated in detail in the subsequent sections.


##### Use Case Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml

' Define the GUI package with the Button class
package gui {
  class Button {
    + viewAll()
    + findByLabel()
    + delete()
  }
}

  class DatabaseConnection {
    + isConnected: boolean

    + connect(): void
    + disconnect(): void
  }

    - coordinate_groups: List<CoordinateGroup>

    + addCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup): void
    + removeCoordinateGroup(id: integer): void
    + findByLabel(label: string): List<CoordinateGroup>
  }
}

' Define the CoordinateGroup class

  + Timestamp: string

}

' Define relationships

This PlantUML code defines the following classes and associations:

1. `Button`: A GUI button class with three types of buttons: View All, Find by Label, and Delete.
2. `CoordinateGroup`: A data model class representing a coordinate group with attributes ID, Timestamp, Label, Polar Coordinates, and Cartesian Coordinates. It also has methods to get polar coordinates and cartesian coordinates.
3. `PolarCoordinates` and `CartesianCoordinates`: Data model classes representing polar and cartesian coordinates respectively.
4. `CoordinateGroupRepository`: A data access class responsible for managing coordinate groups in the database. It has methods to add, remove, and find coordinate groups by label.
5. `DatabaseConnection`: A class responsible for establishing a connection with the database.

The associations between these classes are:

* A `CoordinateGroup` has a composition association with both `PolarCoordinates` and `CartesianCoordinates`.
* A `CoordinateGroupRepository` has an aggregation association with `CoordinateGroup`.
* A `DatabaseConnection` has an aggregation association with `CoordinateGroupRepository`.
