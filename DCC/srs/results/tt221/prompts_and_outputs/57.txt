Question:
Task Description: You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

The requirements for the software we want you to design are in the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) here: # Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

# Dummy Coordinate Converter Application

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Dummy Coordination Conversion Application (DCC app) is an application that manages coordinate groups in Cartesian and Polar formats. The app allows users to input, convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups.

### 1.2 Scope
This application serves as a lightweight tool for managing coordinate groups, used in several calculations by students, engineers, educators, etc.. It provides a GUI developed with Java Swing and supports essential operations such as coordinate conversion, storage, and retrieval. This document contains the requirements specification of the DCC app.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **Cartesian Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using two values: 𝑥 (horizontal position) and 𝑦 (vertical position). Example: (x, y).

- **Polar Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using a radius (𝑟) and an angle (𝜃), measured from the origin. Example: (𝑟, 𝜃).

- **Coordinate Group:**
A collection of coordinates that includes both Cartesian and Polar representations. 

- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.

### 1.5 Overview
This document outlines the software requirements for the DCC Application, detailing functional and non-functional requirements, data organization, and interface expectations. It is structured to facilitate both development and validation processes.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The DCC Application operates as a standalone desktop application, that runs in all modern operating systems (windows, macos and linux). It uses a MySQL database for backend storage and Java Swing for the user interface. Its primary goal is to simplify coordinate system transformations and management.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Create, view, modify, and delete coordinate groups.
- Convert coordinates between Cartesian and Polar systems.
- Store coordinate groups persistently in a database.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users are students, engineers, educators, that need to convert between coordinate systems. No special technical skills are required to operate the software.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Hardware**: Any computer that can run a JRE.
- **Software**: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher, MySQL Server 8.0 or higher.
- **Network**: Required for database access.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The application requires a connection to a MySQL database.
- The Java Swing library is required for running the application's GUI
- A JDBC connector is required for database communication.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements Specification

1. Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
2. Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
3. Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
4. Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
5. Create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
6. Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
7. Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
8. Delete a coordinate group record from the database
9. Provide error handling for invalid inputs.
