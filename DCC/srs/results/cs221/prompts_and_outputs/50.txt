# Dummy Coordinate Converter Application

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Dummy Coordination Conversion Application (DCC app) is an application that manages coordinate groups in Cartesian and Polar formats. The app allows users to input, convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups.

### 1.2 Scope
This application serves as a lightweight tool for managing coordinate groups, used in several calculations by students, engineers, educators, etc.. It provides a GUI developed with Java Swing and supports essential operations such as coordinate conversion, storage, and retrieval. This document contains the requirements specification of the DCC app.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **Cartesian Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using two values: 𝑥 (horizontal position) and 𝑦 (vertical position). Example: (x, y).

- **Polar Coordinates:**
A type of coordinate representation that specifies a point's location using a radius (𝑟) and an angle (𝜃), measured from the origin. Example: (𝑟, 𝜃).

- **Coordinate Group:**
A collection of coordinates that includes both Cartesian and Polar representations. 

- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The DCC Application operates as a standalone desktop application, that runs in all modern operating systems (windows, macos and linux). It uses a MySQL database for backend storage and Java Swing for the user interface. Its primary goal is to simplify coordinate system transformations and management.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Create, view, modify, and delete coordinate groups.
- Convert coordinates between Cartesian and Polar systems.
- Store coordinate groups persistently in a database.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users are students, engineers, educators, that need to convert between coordinate systems. No special technical skills are required to operate the software.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Hardware**: Any computer that can run a JRE.
- **Software**: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher, MySQL Server 8.0 or higher.
- **Network**: Required for database access.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The application requires a connection to a MySQL database.
- The Java Swing library is required for running the application's GUI
- A JDBC connector is required for database communication.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements Specification

1. Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
2. Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
3. Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
4. Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
5. Create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
6. Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id

The demanded Architecture is: Client-Server

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:

The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented.
Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
 Here's a PlantUML-formatted class diagram for the described architecture, requirements, and functionality:

```plantuml
@startuml

package Client {
  class CoordinateGroupForm {
    - String label
    - float polarR
    - float polarTheta
    - float cartesianX
    - float cartesianY
    + createCoordinateGroup()
    + modifyCoordinateGroup()
  }
  
  class CoordinateGroupDisplayList {
    - List<CoordinateGroup> coordinateGroups
    + updateDisplayList()
  }
  
  class MainMenu {
    + navigateToCreate()
    + navigateToModify()
    + navigateToDisplay()
  }
}

package Server {
  class CoordinateGroupRepository {
    - List<CoordinateGroup> coordinateGroups
    
    + create(CoordinateGroup)
    + modify(CoordinateGroup)
    + delete(int id)
    + findAll()
    + findById(int id)
  }
  
  class DatabaseConnection {
    - String url
    - String username
    - String password
    + connect()
    + close()
  }
}

Client ---> Server
DatabaseConnection <-- CoordinateGroupRepository
@enduml
```

This diagram defines classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. The `Client` package includes:
- `CoordinateGroupForm` for creating and modifying coordinate groups.
- `CoordinateGroupDisplayList` to display a list of all coordinate groups.
- `MainMenu` for navigation between views.

The `Server` package contains the following classes:
- `CoordinateGroupRepository` handles the CRUD operations related to the database.
- `DatabaseConnection` manages connecting and closing connections with the MySQL database using JDBC.
