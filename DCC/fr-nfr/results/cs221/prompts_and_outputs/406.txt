Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml
package "frontend" {
  class SwingGUI {
    + displayCoordinateGroups()
    + handleUserInput()
    + updateDisplay()
    + filterCoordinateGroups(label: String)
  }
}

package "logic" {
  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - cartesianX: double
    - cartesianY: double
    - polarR: double
    - polarTheta: double
    + convertCartesianToPolar()
    + convertPolarToCartesian()
  }

  class CoordinateConverter {
    + convertCartesianToPolar(x: double, y: double): (double, double)
    + convertPolarToCartesian(r: double, theta: double): (double, double)
  }
}

package "database" {
  class DatabaseConnector {
    + createGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + readGroups(): List<CoordinateGroup>
    + updateGroup(groupId: int, group: CoordinateGroup)
    + deleteGroup(groupId: int)
  }
}

SwingGUI --|> "logic" : uses
SwingGUI --|> "database" : interacts with
"logic" --> "database" : depends on

**Explanation:**



* **Packages:** The diagram is organized into three packages: "frontend", "logic", and "database". This reflects the separation of concerns based on the client-server architecture.
* **Frontend (SwingGUI):**  This class handles user interactions, input processing, and display updates through the Swing framework. It interacts with both the logic and database packages.
* **Logic:**

    * **CoordinateGroup:** Represents a single coordinate group with its id, label, cartesian coordinates, and polar coordinates. It also includes methods for converting between coordinate systems.
    * **CoordinateConverter:** A utility class responsible for performing conversions between cartesian and polar coordinate formats.
* **Database:**
   * **DatabaseConnector:** Handles communication with the MySQL database server. It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting coordinate group records.

**Associations:**

* **Dependency:** The "logic" package depends on the "database" package because it needs to interact with the database to store and retrieve coordinate groups.
* **Uses:** The "SwingGUI" class in the "frontend" package uses the classes within the "logic" package to process user input, perform calculations, and manage coordinate group data.
* **Interaction:**  The "SwingGUI" interacts with the "DatabaseConnector" class to store, retrieve, update, and delete coordinate groups from the database.

**Key Considerations:**


* This diagram follows the Single Responsibility Principle: each class has a clear and specific responsibility (e.g., handling user interface, performing conversions, managing database interaction).
* The PlantUML code provides a concise and visually understandable representation of the software architecture.
