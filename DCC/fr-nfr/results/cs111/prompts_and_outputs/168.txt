Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml

package "Client" {
  class DCCApp {
    + run()
    - createCoordinateGroup(type: String, values: List<Double>) : CoordinateGroup
    - storeCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    - retrieveCoordinateGroups(method: String, label: String) : List<CoordinateGroup>
    - modifyCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup, newValues: List<Double>, newLabel: String)
    - deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int)
  }

  class CoordinateConverter {
    + cartesianToPolar(x: double, y: double): (double, double)
    + polarToCartesian(r: double, theta: double): (double, double)
  }

}

package "Server" {
  class DatabaseConnection {
    + connectToDatabase()
    - executeQuery(query: String): List<Object>
  }

  class CoordinateGroupDAO {
    - dbConnection: DatabaseConnection
    + saveCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + getCoordinateGroupsByLabel(label: String) : List<CoordinateGroup>
    + getAllCoordinateGroups(): List<CoordinateGroup>
    + updateCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int)

  }

}

package "Data" {
  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - timestamp: Date
    - cartesianCoordinates: (double, double)
    - polarCoordinates: (double, double)
    + getCoordinatesByType(type: String): (double, double)

  }
}


DCCApp --> CoordinateConverter
DCCApp --> CoordinateGroupDAO

CoordinateGroupDAO --> DatabaseConnection

**Explanation:**

* **Packages:** The diagram uses packages to separate concerns - `Client` for the user interface and logic, `Server` for database interactions, and `Data` for data structures.

* **Classes:**
    * `DCCApp`: Represents the main application class handling user interaction and calling appropriate methods based on user actions.
    * `CoordinateConverter`: Handles conversions between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    * `DatabaseConnection`: Manages the connection to the MySQL database.
    * `CoordinateGroupDAO`: Data Access Object responsible for interacting with the database (CRUD operations) on `CoordinateGroup` objects.
    * `CoordinateGroup`: Represents a coordinate group containing both Cartesian and polar representations along with ID, label, and timestamp.

* **Associations:** 
    * The diagram uses arrows to show relationships between classes:
        * `DCCApp` "uses" (`-->`) `CoordinateConverter`.
        * `DCCApp` "uses" (`-->`) `CoordinateGroupDAO`.
        * `CoordinateGroupDAO` "has a" (`-->`)  `DatabaseConnection`.
