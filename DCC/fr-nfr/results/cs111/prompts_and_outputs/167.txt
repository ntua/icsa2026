Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

```plantuml

package "Client" {
  class DCCApp {
    - String serverAddress
    + void connectToServer()
    + CoordinateGroup createCoordinateGroup()
    + void storeCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + CoordinateGroup retrieveCoordinateGroup(String label)
    + void modifyCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + void deleteCoordinateGroup(String label)
  }
}

package "Server" {
  class CoordinateGroup {
    - int id
    - String label
    - long timestamp
    - List<Coordinate> cartesianCoordinates
    - List<Coordinate> polarCoordinates
    + void convertCoordinates()
  }

  class Coordinate {
    - double value
    + Coordinate(double value)
  }

  class Server {
    - MySQLDatabase dbConnection
    + void handleClientRequest(DCCApp client)
    + void storeCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + CoordinateGroup retrieveCoordinateGroup(String label)
    + void modifyCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + void deleteCoordinateGroup(String label)
  }

  class MySQLDatabase {
    + void connect()
    + void insertCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + CoordinateGroup selectCoordinateGroup(String label)
    + void updateCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup cg)
    + void deleteCoordinateGroup(String label)
  }
}

DCCApp "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : uses
Server "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : manages
MySQLDatabase "*" -- "*" Server : connects to

**Explanation:**



* **Client (DCCApp):** This class represents the Java application running on the client machine. It handles user interaction, creates coordinate groups, and sends requests to the server for storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion.
* **Server:**  This class manages communication with clients, receives requests, and interacts with the MySQL database to perform data operations.
* **CoordinateGroup:** Represents a group of coordinates (Cartesian or Polar) along with an ID, label, timestamp, and methods for conversion.

* **Coordinate:** A simple class representing a single coordinate value with its type determined by context (Cartesian or polar).

* **MySQLDatabase:**  Handles the connection to and interaction with the MySQL database for storing and retrieving coordinate groups.
* **Associations:**


   * The "uses" association between `DCCApp` and `CoordinateGroup` shows that the client application uses coordinate group objects.

   * The "manages" association between `Server` and `CoordinateGroup` indicates that the server is responsible for managing and storing coordinate groups in the database. 

   * The "connects to" association represents the relationship between the `MySQLDatabase` and the `Server`, highlighting the server's dependency on the database for data persistence.
