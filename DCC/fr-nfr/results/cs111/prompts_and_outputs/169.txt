Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

      + getAllCoordinateGroups() : List<CoordinateGroup>
      + deleteCoordinateGroup(id: Integer)
    }

  class CartesianCoordinates {
    - x: Double
    - y: Double
  }

  class PolarCoordinates {
    - radius: Double
    - theta: Double
  }

  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: Integer
    - label: String
    - creationTimestamp: DateTime
    - coordinates: List<Coordinate>
  }

  class Coordinate {
    + getValues(): List<Double>
  }

  SwingUI --> CoordinateConverter : uses
  SwingUI --> DatabaseManager : uses
  CoordinateGroup "1" *-- "*" Coordinate : contains

**Explanation:**

* **Client Tier (SwingUI):** Handles user interaction via the Swing framework. It displays coordinate groups, receives user input for creating and modifying coordinates, and communicates with the server tier to save, retrieve, and delete coordinate groups. 

* **Server Tier:** Contains the core logic of the application.
    *  **CoordinateConverter:** Handles conversion between Cartesian and polar coordinate systems.
    * **DatabaseManager:** Manages interactions with the MySQL database, including saving, retrieving, and deleting coordinate groups.

* **Data Classes:** Represent the actual coordinates (CartesianCoordinates, PolarCoordinates) and the CoordinateGroup that stores them along with a label and timestamp.


**Key Points:**



* **Separation of Concerns:** The diagram clearly shows the separation between the client tier responsible for user interaction and the server tier handling application logic and database operations.
* **Abstraction:** Classes like `DatabaseManager` abstract away complex database interactions, making the code easier to maintain and modify.

* **Associations:**


    *  The `SwingUI` class uses both the `CoordinateConverter` and `DatabaseManager`.

    * The `CoordinateGroup` contains a list of `Coordinate` objects (either Cartesian or Polar).
