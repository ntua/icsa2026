Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml
package "Client" {
    class DCCApplication {
        + createCoordinateGroup(type: String, values: double[])
        + storeCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
        + retrieveCoordinateGroups(criteria: String)
        + modifyCoordinateGroup(groupId: int, modifications: Map<String, Object>)
        + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int)

    }
    class CoordinateConverter {
        + cartesianToPolar(x: double, y: double): double[]
        + polarToCartesian(r: double, theta: double): double[]
    }
    DCCApplication --> CoordinateConverter
}

package "Server" {
  class MySQLDatabase {
      - connect()
      - disconnect()
      + storeCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup) : int
      + getCoordinateGroups(criteria: String) : List<CoordinateGroup>
      + updateCoordinateGroup(groupId: int, modifications: Map<String, Object>)
      + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int)
  }
  class CoordinateGroup {
      - id: int
      - label: String
      - timestamp: Date
      - cartesianCoordinates: double[] 
      - polarCoordinates: double[]

      + getCartesianCoordinates(): double[]
      + setCartesianCoordinates(double[] coordinates): void
      + getPolarCoordinates(): double[]
      + setPolarCoordinates(double[] coordinates): void
  }

  MySQLDatabase <-- CoordinateGroup : "stores"
}

DCCApplication --> MySQLDatabase: "communicates via TCP/IP"

**Explanation:**

* **Client Package**: Contains the application logic for user interaction, coordinate group creation, and communication with the server. 
    * `DCCApplication`: Handles overall application logic, interacts with the user interface, and communicates with the database server.
    * `CoordinateConverter`: Responsible for converting between Cartesian and polar coordinate systems.

* **Server Package**: Handles storage and retrieval of coordinate groups from a MySQL database.
    * `MySQLDatabase`: Implements database connection logic, data manipulation (CRUD operations) for `CoordinateGroup` objects.
    * `CoordinateGroup`: Represents a single coordinate group with attributes for ID, label, timestamp, Cartesian coordinates, and polar coordinates.

**Associations:**


* **Communication**: The `DCCApplication` communicates with the `MySQLDatabase` via TCP/IP protocol for data exchange. This is represented by a dashed line with the label "communicates via TCP/IP".
* **Storage**: The `MySQLDatabase` stores instances of `CoordinateGroup`. This relationship is shown by a solid arrow pointing from `MySQLDatabase` to `CoordinateGroup` and labeled "stores."
