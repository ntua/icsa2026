Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Client-Server

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

**Explanation:**


* **Packages:**  The diagram is divided into logical packages: Frontend, Domain, Database, and Network. This reflects the separation of concerns within the application.

* **Classes:** Key classes are defined based on functionality:
    * **Frontend:** Handles user interaction through `CoordinateGroupCreator`, `CoordinateGroupEditor`, `CoordinateGroupViewer`. `DCCApplication` orchestrates the frontend logic.
    * **Domain:** Represents core business logic with `CoordinateGroup`, `CoordinateType`, and concrete coordinate types (`CartesianCoordinate`, `PolarCoordinate`). 
    * **Database:**  Contains `DatabaseManager` for interacting with the MySQL database.
    * **Network:** Handles communication with the server through the `Client`.

* **Associations:**
    * **Uses:** Represents dependency relationships (e.g., `DCCApplication` uses classes for creating, editing, and viewing coordinate groups).
    * **Creates:** Shows the creation relationship between `CoordinateGroupCreator` and `CoordinateGroup`.
    * **Contains:** Indicates that a `CoordinateGroup` contains an array of `Coordinate` objects.
    * **Stores/Communicates with:** Represents the database interaction using `DatabaseManager`.

**Key Points:**


* This diagram focuses on the structural design of the application.

* It doesn't include details like specific database queries or frontend UI layouts, as those are implementation concerns.

* You can refine and extend this diagram further based on more detailed requirements and design decisions.
