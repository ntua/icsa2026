 
MVC (Model -View -Controller) architecture example:  
Problem Description:  
A car rental company wants to develop a software system that will enable customers to rent cars online. Customers should be able to browse available cars, select a car to rent, and make a reservation. The 
system should keep track of the availability of cars, as well as the reservations made by customers. Identify Use Cases  
• Browse available cars  
• Select a car to rent  
• Make a reservation

CarRentalModel --> Database : Connection

The Model  includes the  Customer , Car, and  Reservation  entities , along with methods for fetching  for cars 
and making reservations. The View  is represented by the CarRentalView, which defines methods for displaying cars and reservation 
details. (Score: 0.9491072924420555)

User Management : Register new users, update user information, and manage user records. 3. Transaction Management : Facilitate book borrowing and returning, tracking user and book 
details for each transaction. 4. Data Storage : Store and retrieve all book, user, and transaction data in a centralized server 
database. Class diagram in plantUML of the application with client -server architecture pattern:  
@startuml  
package "Client" {  
    class LibraryApp {  
      - bookManager: BookManager  
      - userManager: UserManager  
      - transactionManager: TransactionManager

Software Architecture Patterns and corresponding UML class diagrams  
 
Software architecture is like the blueprint for building software, showing how different parts fit 
together and interact. It helps the development team understand how to build the software 
according to customer requirements. (Score: 1.069093422655836)

Its main purpose is to display information to and collect 
information from the user. This top -level tier can run on a  web browser, as desktop application, 
or a graphical user interface (GUI), for example. • Application tier  
The application tier, also known as the logic tier or middle tier, is the heart of the application. In 
this tier, information that is collected in the presentation tier is processed - sometimes against 
other information in the data tier - using business lo gic, a specific set of business rules. • Data tier  
The data tier, sometimes called database tier, data access tier or back -end, is where the 
information that is processed by the application is stored and managed. This can be a  relational 
database system  or in a  NoSQL  Database server . Important info:  In a three -tier application, all communication goes through the application tier. • The Presentation Layer  should never directly access the  Data Layer . All requests go through 
the Application Layer . • Application Logic  should act as a middleman, containing all business rules. To further clarify “Three -tier” architecture, let's explore a specific example . Three -tier architecture example:  
Requirements:  
E-commerce websites  
• Presentation Layer:  The online storefront with product catalogs, shopping carts, and 
checkout interfaces. • Logic Layer:  Handles searching, order processing, inventory management, interfacing with 
3rd-party payment vendors, and business rules like discounts and promotions. • Data Layer:  Stores product information, customer data, order history, and financial 
transactions in a database. Class Diagram in PlantUML  for above problem with Three -tier architecture : 
@startuml  
class Storefront {  
- ProductCatalog : List<Product>  
- ShoppingCart : ShoppingCart  
- CheckoutInterface : Checkout  
+ viewProducts() : void  
+ addToCart(product: Product) : void  
+ proceedToCheckout() : void  
} 
package "Logic Layer" {  
class OrderProcessor {  
- paymentProcessor : PaymentProcessor  
- inventoryManager : InventoryManager   (Score: 1.0853726388059113)

Model – View – Controller (MVC)  Architecture : 
The MVC framework is a software architecture that separates the user interface (UI), data storage, 
and business logic into three separate components. This allows developers to work on each 
component independently without affecting the other two parts of th e application. (Score: 1.1425532980776216)
