To further clarify “Model -View -Controller ” architecture, let's explore a specific example . MVC (Model -View -Controller)  architecture example:  
Problem Description:  
A car rental company wants to develop a software system that will enable customers to rent cars online. Customers should be able to browse available cars, select a car to rent, and make a reservation. The 
system should keep track of the availability of cars, as well as the reservations made by customers. Identify Use Cases  
• Browse available cars  
• Select a car to rent  
• Make a reservation  
 
UML class diagram  for above problem with MVC architecture : 
 @startuml  
  class CarRentalView {  
    +displayCar()  
    +displayReservationDetails()  
  } 
 
class CarRentalController {  
    -model: CarRentalModel  
    -view: CarRentalView  
    +searchCars()  
    +reserveCars()  
  } 
   
class CarRentalModel {  
    -customers: List<>  
    -cars: List<>  
    -reservations: List<>  
    +fetchCars()  
    +updateReservationDetails()  
  } 
CarRentalView -- CarRentalController: Request/Response  
CarRentalController --> CarRentalModel : Request Data  
CarRentalModel --> Database : Connection  
@enduml  
 
 
The Model  includes the  Customer , Car, and  Reservation  entities , along with methods for fetching  for cars 
and making reservations. The View  is represented by the CarRentalView, which defines methods for displaying cars and reservation 
details. (Score: 1.0548739726196477)

Software Architecture Patterns and corresponding UML class diagrams  
 
The big picture  
Architectural design  is a process for identifying the sub -systems making up a system and the 
framework for sub -system control and communication. The output of this design process is a 
description of the software architecture. (Score: 1.0864603439435703)

• Application Logic  should act as a middleman, containing all business rules. To further clarify “Three -tier” architecture, let's explore a specific example . Three -tier architecture example:  
Requirements:  
E-commerce websites  
• Presentation Layer:  The online storefront with product catalogs, shopping carts, and 
checkout interfaces. • Logic Layer:  Handles searching, order processing, inventory management, interfacing with 
3rd-party payment vendors, and business rules like discounts and promotions. • Data Layer:  Stores product information, customer data, order history, and financial 
transactions in a database. Class Diagram in PlantUML  for above problem with Three -tier architecture : 
@startuml  
class Storefront {  
- ProductCatalog : List<Product>  
- ShoppingCart : ShoppingCart  
- CheckoutInterface : Checkout  
+ viewProducts() : void  
+ addToCart(product: Product) : void  
+ proceedToCheckout() : void  
} 
package "Logic Layer" {  
class OrderProcessor {  
- paymentProcessor : PaymentProcessor  
- inventoryManager : InventoryManager  
+ processOrder(order: Order) : void  
+ applyDiscount(order: Order, discountCode: String) : float  
} 
 
class InventoryManager {  
+ checkStock(product: Product) : boolean  
+ updateStock(product: Product, quantity: int) : void  
}

May be management problems if servers are owned by different organizations. To further clarify “ Client -Server ” architecture, let's explore a specific example. Client -Server example:  
Application Description : The Library Management System  is a desktop application for librarians, 
enabling them to manage book collections, user information, and borrowing transactions. Operating 
with a thick client architecture, the application handles all business logic locally, while a server 
database stores and retrieves data. Functional Requirements  
1. Book Management : Add, update, and delete book records, including details such as title, 
author, ISBN, and availability status. 2. User Management : Register new users, update user information, and manage user records. 3. Transaction Management : Facilitate book borrowing and returning, tracking user and book 
details for each transaction. 4. Data Storage : Store and retrieve all book, user, and transaction data in a centralized server 
database. Class diagram in plantUML of the application with client -server architecture pattern:  
@startuml  
package "Client" {  
    class LibraryApp {  
      - bookManager: BookManager  
      - userManager: UserManager  
      - transactionManager: TransactionManager  
      + run()   (Score: 1.1039646958215543)

Client -server architecture  
• Distributed system model which shows how data and processing is distributed across a 
range of components, but can also be implemented on a single computer. • Set of stand -alone servers which provide specific services such as printing, data 
management, etc. (Score: 1.1550569779048476)
