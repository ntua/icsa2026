Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - timestamp: Date
    - coordinates: List<Double> 
  }
}

package "Data Access Layer" {
  class DatabaseConnector {
    + connectToDatabase()
    + executeQuery(query: String) : ResultSet
  }
}

**Explanation:**

* **Presentation Layer (DCCGUI):** Handles user interactions, displaying data, and gathering input.

* **Logic Layer:** Contains the core business logic of the application. 
    * **CoordinateConverter:** Handles the conversion between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    * **CoordinateGroupManager:** Manages coordinate group creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion. It interacts with the DatabaseConnector to persist data.
* **Data Access Layer (DatabaseConnector):** Responsible for connecting to the MySQL database and executing SQL queries.

* **Associations:** The diagram shows the "Uses" association between classes, illustrating how they depend on each other's functionality.
