Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml
' Start of class diagram using PlantUML'


class UserInterface {
    +String label;
    +void createCoordinateGroup(String inputType);
    +void modifyCoordinateGroup();
}

class DatabaseConnection {
    +int connectionId;
    +DatabaseConnection() connects to "MySQL";
    +void saveCoordinateGroup(Coordinate group) saves the coordinate group in the database.
    +List<Coordinate> retrieveAllGroups() retrieves all coordinate groups from the database.
}

class Coordinate {
  -double x; 'Cartesian' or '-radius r'; 'Polar'
  -double y;   'Cartesian'
  -double theta; 'Polar'
    *Coordinate(x,y) constructs a new coordinate object with given values.
}

class CoordinateGroup {
 +List<Coordinate> coordinates;
 +String label;
 +void addCoordinate(Coordinate coord);
 +void removeCoordinate(Coordinate coord);
 }

UserInterface "1" *--* "0..*" DatabaseConnection: uses database connection to save/retrieve data.
DatabaseConnection "0..*" --* UserInterface: handles user input and output requests.

This PlantUML diagram outlines the basic structure of the Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application based on a three-tier architecture with Java Swing frontend, MySQL database storage, and TCP/IP connection handling. It contains four packages: UserInterface, DatabaseConnection, Coordinate, and CoordinateGroup.

UserInterface represents the user interface developed using the Java framework. This package includes methods for coordinate group creation and modification (createCoordinateGroup and modifyCoordinateGroup).

DatabaseConnection handles communication between the application and MySQL database. It contains methods to save a new coordinate group in the database, retrieve all stored coordinate groups, and connects to "MySQL".

The Coordinate class represents Cartesian or polar coordinates with x-y (Cartesian) or r-theta (Polar) attributes. This class is used within the CoordinateGroup package as well.

Finally, CoordinateGroup represents a set of Coordinates that can be retrieved, modified and deleted from the database by using DatabaseConnection methods. It includes an attribute label for user identification purposes and methods to add or remove coordinates (addCoordinate and removeCoordinate).
