Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

package "Client" {
  class DCCApp {
    + run()
    - selectedCoordinates: CoordinateGroup
  }
  class CoordinateGroupManager {
    + createCoordinateGroup(type: String, coordinates: List<Double>): CoordinateGroup
    + storeCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + retrieveCoordinateGroup(label: String): CoordinateGroup

    + updateCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(id: Integer)
  }

}

package "Database" {
  interface DatabaseConnection {
    + connect()
    + disconnect()
    + executeQuery(query: String): ResultSet
  }

  class MySQLDatabaseConnection {
    - host: String
    - port: Integer
    - username: String
    - password: String
    + connect(): void
    + disconnect(): void
    + executeQuery(query: String): ResultSet
  }
}

DCCApp --> CoordinateGroupManager : uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> CoordinateConverter : uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> MySQLDatabaseConnection : uses
MySQLDatabaseConnection --|> DatabaseConnection

**Explanation:**

* **Client Package:** Contains the user interface logic (`DCCApp`) and the logic for managing coordinate groups (`CoordinateGroupManager`).

* **Logic Layer Package:** Handles the conversion between Cartesian and polar coordinates (`CoordinateConverter`) and defines the structure of a `CoordinateGroup`. It also includes classes for representing Cartesian and Polar coordinates themselves.

* **Database Package:** Contains the interface for database connection (`DatabaseConnection`) and a concrete implementation for MySQL (`MySQLDatabaseConnection`).



**Key Points:**


* **Separation of Concerns:** The diagram clearly shows the separation of responsibilities between the client, logic layer, and database access.
* **Associations:** 
    * The `DCCApp` class uses the `CoordinateGroupManager`.

    * The `CoordinateGroupManager` uses the `CoordinateConverter` for conversion operations and the `MySQLDatabaseConnection` to interact with the database.

    * `MySQLDatabaseConnection` implements the `DatabaseConnection` interface, showcasing polymorphism.
* **Classes:** Each class is defined with relevant attributes and methods based on its purpose.
