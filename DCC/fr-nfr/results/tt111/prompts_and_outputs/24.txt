Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml

package "Frontend" {
  class DCCGUI {
    + showCoordinateGroups()
    + createCoordinateGroup()
    + modifyCoordinateGroup()
    + deleteCoordinateGroup()
  }

}

package "Business Logic" {
  class CoordinateGroupController {
    - coordinateGroupService: CoordinateGroupService
    + createCoordinateGroup(coordinates: String, type: String)
    + getCoordinateGroups(): List<CoordinateGroup>
    + getCoordinateGroup(label: String): CoordinateGroup
    + modifyCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup)
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(id: int)
  }

  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - timestamp: Date
    - cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates
    - polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates

    + getCartesianCoordinates(): CartesianCoordinates
    + setCartesianCoordinates(coordinates: CartesianCoordinates)
    + getPolarCoordinates(): PolarCoordinates
    + setPolarCoordinates(coordinates: PolarCoordinates)
  }

  class CartesianCoordinates {
    - x: double
    - y: double
  }

  class PolarCoordinates {
    - r: double
    - theta: double
  }

}

package "Data Access" {
  class CoordinateGroupService {
    - databaseConnection: DatabaseConnection
    + createCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup): void
    + getCoordinateGroups(): List<CoordinateGroup>
    + getCoordinateGroup(label: String): CoordinateGroup
    + modifyCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup): void
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(id: int): void
  }

  class DatabaseConnection {
    + connectToDatabase()
    + executeQuery(query: String) : ResultSet
  }

  CoordinateGroupService --> DatabaseConnection : uses
  DCCGUI --> CoordinateGroupController : uses
  CoordinateGroupController --> CoordinateGroupService : uses
  CoordinateGroupController --> CoordinateGroup : creates & modifies
  CoordinateGroup --> CartesianCoordinates : has a
  CoordinateGroup --> PolarCoordinates : has a
}

**Explanation:**


* **Frontend Package:** Contains the `DCCGUI` class, which handles user interaction and displays data. It interacts with the `CoordinateGroupController` to perform actions.
* **Business Logic Package:**
    *  `CoordinateGroupController`: Acts as a mediator between the frontend and the data access layer. It receives requests from the GUI, prepares data for database operations, and returns results to the GUI.
    *  `CoordinateGroup`: Represents a coordinate group with both Cartesian and polar coordinates, label, and timestamp attributes.
    *  `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates`: Represent respective coordinate types.
* **Data Access Package:**
    * `CoordinateGroupService`: Handles database interactions using SQL queries. It connects to the MySQL database (`DatabaseConnection`) and executes appropriate queries based on requests from the controller.

**Associations:**


* The diagram shows clear associations between classes:


    * Composition: `CoordinateGroupController` "has a" `CoordinateGroupService`.
    * Association/Dependency: `DCCGUI` "uses" `CoordinateGroupController`, and `CoordinateGroupController` "uses" `CoordinateGroupService`.

* Inheritance is not used in this specific example as there are no clear hierarchical relationships between the classes.
