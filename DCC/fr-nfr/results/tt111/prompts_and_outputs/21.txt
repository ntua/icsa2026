Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml
package "frontend" {
  class CoordinateGroupView {
    + displayCoordinateGroups()
    + createCoordinateGroup()
    + modifyCoordinateGroup()
    + deleteCoordinateGroup()
  }
  class InputHandler {
    - processInput(String inputType, String coordinates)
  }
  class ConversionManager {
    + convertCartesianToPolar(double x, double y)
    + convertPolarToCartesian(double r, double theta)
  }

}

package "businesslogic" {
  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - timestamp: Date
    - cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates
    - polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates
  }
  class CartesianCoordinates {
    - x: double
    - y: double
  }
  class PolarCoordinates {
    - r: double
    - theta: double
  }

  CoordinateGroup "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroupView : uses
  CoordinateGroup "1" -- "1" ConversionManager : uses
}

package "database" {

  class DatabaseConnection {
    + connectToDatabase()
    + storeCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
    + retrieveCoordinateGroup(String label)
    + retrieveAllCoordinateGroups()
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(int id)
  }

  class MySQLDatabase {
    - tables: List<Table>
  }


}



CoordinateGroupView -- "1" InputHandler : uses
InputHandler -- "1" ConversionManager : delegates conversion to
ConversionManager -- "1" CoordinateGroup : creates/updates


DatabaseConnection "1" -- "1" MySQLDatabase

**Explanation:**


* **Packages:** The diagram is divided into three packages representing the frontend, business logic, and database layers. This reflects the three-tier architecture.
* **Frontend (GUI):** 
    * `CoordinateGroupView` handles user interactions through the Swing framework.
    *  `InputHandler` processes user input and delegates conversions to `ConversionManager`.

* **Business Logic:**
    * `CoordinateGroup` represents a coordinate group with its ID, label, timestamp, and both Cartesian and Polar coordinates. 
    * `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates` are classes representing the respective coordinate types.
    * `ConversionManager` handles conversions between Cartesian and polar coordinates.

* **Database:** 
    * `DatabaseConnection` manages the connection to the MySQL database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on `CoordinateGroup` objects.

**Associations:**

*  **Composition:** The `CoordinateGroupView` uses an `InputHandler`, which delegates conversions to a `ConversionManager`.

* **Aggregation:** 
    *  A `CoordinateGroup` "has-a" relationship with `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates`.

* **Dependency:** The `DatabaseConnection` depends on the `MySQLDatabase` for database interactions.
