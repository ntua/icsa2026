Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
```plantuml
@startuml
package "Presentation Layer" {
  class Frontend {
    - SwingFramework : SwingFramework
    + createCoordinateGroup() : CoordinateGroup
    + modifyCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup) : void
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int) : void
    + viewAllGroups() : List<CoordinateGroup>
  }
}

package "Business Logic Layer" {
  class CoordinateConverter {
    - conversionMatrix : ConversionMatrix
    + convertToCartesian(polar: PolarCoordinates) : CartesianCoordinates
    + convertToPolar(cartesian: CartesianCoordinates) : PolarCoordinates
  }

  class CoordinateManager {
    - coordinateGroups : List<CoordinateGroup>
    + createCoordinateGroup(label: String, cartesian: CartesianCoordinates, polar: PolarCoordinates) : int
    + retrieveByLabel(groupId: int) : CoordinateGroup
    + updateCoordinateGroup(groupId: int, label: String, cartesian: CartesianCoordinates, polar: PolarCoordinates) : void
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int) : void
  }
}

package "Data Access Layer" {
  class MySQLDatabase {
    - coordinateGroupsTable : Table
    + storeCoordinateGroup(group: CoordinateGroup) : void
    + retrieveByLabel(label: String) : CoordinateGroup
    + updateCoordinateGroup(groupId: int, label: String, cartesian: CartesianCoordinates, polar: PolarCoordinates) : void
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(groupId: int) : void
  }
  class CoordinateGroup{}
}

package "TCP/IP Connection" {
  class TCPClient {
    - socket : Socket
    + sendRequest(request: Request) : Response
    + closeConnection() : void
  }
}

Frontend --> TCPClient : Uses
CoordinateConverter --> CoordinateManager : Uses
MySQLDatabase --> TCPClient : Accesses

CoordinateGroup --> MySQLDatabase : Composition (via CoordinateManager)

This plantUML code defines the three-layered architecture as requested, with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: The `Frontend` class is responsible for handling user interactions using the Swing framework. It provides methods to create, modify, and delete coordinate groups.
- **Business Logic Layer**:
  - The `CoordinateConverter` class handles conversions between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
  - The `CoordinateManager` class manages the storage, retrieval, update, and deletion of coordinate groups. It utilizes the `MySQLDatabase` class for data access.
- **Data Access Layer**: The `MySQLDatabase` class provides database operations (insertion, selection, updating, and deletion) using SQL queries. It utilizes a TCP/IP connection for communication with the application.
- **TCP/IP Connection**:

This design ensures that each layer focuses on its specific responsibilities, promoting maintainability, scalability, and ease of modification.

Note: The association between `CoordinateGroup` and `MySQLDatabase` is composition, indicating that a coordinate group is stored in the database.
