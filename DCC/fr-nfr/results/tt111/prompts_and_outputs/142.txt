Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
Here's a PlantUML class diagram that represents the described software architecture for the Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application:

@startuml

package "Presentation Layer" {
  class MainWindow{}
}


package "Application Tier" {
class CoordinateGroup {
    +int id : "unique auto-generated identifier"
    +string label : "user-defined string label for identification"
    +long timestamp : "automatically assigned timestamp"
    +void store(CoordinateGroupViewer, CoordinateGroup)
    +CoordinateGroup[] getGroupsByLabel(CoordinateGroupViewer, string query)
    +void modify(CoordinateGroupViewer, CoordinateGroup, int x, int y, double r, double theta)
    +boolean delete(CoordinateGroupViewer, CoordinateGroup)
}



class CoordinateGroupViewer {
    +void displayGroups()
    +CoordinateGroup[] getAllGroups()
    +boolean search(string query)
}

class CoordinateGroupCreationPanel {
    +CoordinateGroup createCartesianPolar(int x, int y, string label)
    +CoordinateGroup convertToPolar(double r, double theta, string label)
}
}

package "Data Tier" {

class DatabaseConnector {
    -String connectionString : "TCP/IP Connection details"
}

class MySQLDatabaseAdapter {
    #methods for storing and retrieving coordinate groups from MySQL database
}
}

CoordinateGroupViewer -> CoordinateGroupManager : one - uses
MainWindow --> CoordinateGroupCreationPanel
CoordinateGroupManager -> CoordinateConverter : one - uses
DatabaseConnector --> MySQLDatabaseAdapter : extends
TCPConnectionHandler --> MySQLDatabaseAdapter : contains
CoordinateGroup --> MySQLDatabaseAdapter : one - uses
CoordinateGroupViewer --> CoordinateGroupManager: viewers use managers to access coordinate groups
