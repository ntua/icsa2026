Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

    }

    class DataAccessor {

    }
  }

  CoordinateConverter --> CoordinateGroupManager : "Provides conversion logic for"
  DataAccessor --> MySQLDatabase : "Performs database CRUD operations"
  CoordinateGroupManager --> MySQLDatabase : "Manages coordinates data in"
}

package "Model" {
  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - cartesianX: double
    - cartesianY: double
    - polarR: double
    - polarTheta: double
    + getCartesianCoordinates(): (double, double)
    + getPolarCoordinates(): (double, double)
  }
}

**Explanation:**


* **Three-Tier Architecture:** The diagram reflects the three-tier architecture with distinct Presentation, Logic, and Data tiers.

* **Components:**
   * **CoordinateConverter:** Responsible for converting between Cartesian and Polar coordinates.
   * **CoordinateGroupManager:** Handles business logic related to coordinate groups: creating, reading, updating, and deleting them. It uses the `DataAccessor` to interact with the database.
    * **DataAccessor:** Abstracts database interactions (CRUD operations) using a connection to the MySQL database.

* **Model:** 
  * The "Model" package encapsulates the core data structure: the `CoordinateGroup` class. 
   * It stores both Cartesian and Polar coordinates for each group, along with an ID, label, and timestamps for creation/modification.


* **Relationships:**

    *  **Composition:**  The `CoordinateConverter` is composed within the `CoordinateGroupManager`.
    * **Dependency:** The `CoordinateGroupManager` depends on the `DataAccessor` to interact with the database. 

* **Database:**

   * The MySQL database stores coordinate group data persistently using a TCP/IP connection.


**Important Considerations:**


* **Frontend (Presentation Tier):** This diagram does not explicitly show the Java Swing frontend, as its details are less relevant to the core architectural design. However, it would interact with the `CoordinateGroupManager` to handle user input and display results.

* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has a specific responsibility:
   *  `CoordinateConverter`: Handles coordinate conversion logic. 
   *  `CoordinateGroupManager`: Manages database operations and business logic related to coordinate groups. 
   * `DataAccessor`: Abstracts database interaction, making it easier to change databases in the future.
