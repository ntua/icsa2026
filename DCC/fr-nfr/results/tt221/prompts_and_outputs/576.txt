Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

Okay, so I need to create a PlantUML class diagram for the Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application based on the given requirements and the Three-Tier architecture. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in a Three-Tier architecture, there are three main layers: Presentation Layer, Logic Layer (or Business Logic Layer), and Data Access Layer. Each layer has specific responsibilities.

Looking at the functional requirements, they're divided into Logic, Data operations, and User interactions. The Non-Functional Requirements mention using Java with Swing for the frontend, Java classes for logic, MySQL for the database, and TCP/IP for connectivity. Also, the Single Responsibility Principle is important here, so each class should handle one task.

Starting with the Presentation Layer. Since it's a Swing application, I'll need a class that handles the user interface. Let me call it CoordinateGroupGUI. It should have methods like displayCoordinateGroups(), addCoordinateGroup(), updateCoordinateGroup(), deleteCoordinateGroup(), and filterCoordinateGroups(). These methods correspond to the user interactions in the requirements.

Next, the Logic Layer. The application deals with coordinate conversions between Cartesian and Polar formats. I'll need classes for each type of coordinate: CartesianCoordinates and PolarCoordinates. Each should have attributes for their values (x, y for Cartesian; r, θ for Polar) and methods like convertToPolar() or convertToCartesian(). 

There's also the CoordinateGroup class, which contains both types of coordinates along with a label and an id. This class will be used across layers.

Then, the ConversionService class in the Logic Layer will handle the business logic. It should have methods to create, read, update, delete coordinate groups, and convert between coordinate types. These methods will interact with both the GUI and the Data Access Layer.

Now, the Data Access Layer. There needs to be a way to interact with the MySQL database. I'll create a CoordinateGroupDAO (Data Access Object) class responsible for CRUD operations: createCoordinateGroup(), readAllCoordinateGroups(), updateCoordinateGroup(), deleteCoordinateGroup(). It should also handle filtering by label.

The DatabaseConnection class will manage the connection to MySQL using TCP/IP. It'll have methods like connect() and disconnect().

Associations between classes are important. The GUI uses the ConversionService, which in turn uses CoordinateGroupDAO for database operations. The DAO uses DatabaseConnection to interact with the database. ConversionService also uses the coordinate classes to perform conversions. Each layer is separate but connected through these associations.

I need to make sure each class has proper attributes and methods based on the requirements. For example, the GUI's display method calls the service's readAll method, which in turn uses the DAO to fetch data from the database.

Also, considering the Single Responsibility Principle, each class should do one thing: GUI handles UI, service handles logic, DAO handles data access, and so on.

Putting it all together, I structure the PlantUML code with packages for Presentation, Logic, and Data Access. Each package contains the relevant classes with their attributes and methods. Associations are shown with arrows indicating which class uses another.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, to write out the PlantUML code accordingly.

Here is the PlantUML class diagram that models the Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application according to the Three-Tier architecture and the specified requirements:

```plantuml

' Presentation Layer
package "Presentation" {
    class CoordinateGroupGUI {
        + void displayCoordinateGroups()
        + void addCoordinateGroup()
        + void updateCoordinateGroup()
        + void deleteCoordinateGroup()
        + void filterCoordinateGroups(String label)
        
        + CoordinateGroupGUI()
    }
}

' Business Logic Layer
package "Logic" {
    class CartesianCoordinates {
        - double x
        - double y
        
        + CartesianCoordinates(double x, double y)
        + PolarCoordinates convertToPolar()
    }

    class PolarCoordinates {
        - double r
        - double θ
        
        + PolarCoordinates(double r, double θ)
        + CartesianCoordinates convertToCartesian()
    }

    class CoordinateGroup {
        - int id
        - String label
        - CartesianCoordinates cartesian
        - PolarCoordinates polar
        
        + CoordinateGroup(int id, String label, CartesianCoordinates cartesian, PolarCoordinates polar)
    }

    class ConversionService {
        + void createCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
        + List<CoordinateGroup> readAllCoordinateGroups()
        + void updateCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
        + void deleteCoordinateGroup(int id)
        + CoordinateGroup convertCartesianToPolar(CartesianCoordinates cartesian)
        + CoordinateGroup convertPolarToCartesian(PolarCoordinates polar)
    }
}

' Data Access Layer
package "Data Access" {
    class CoordinateGroupDAO {
        + void createCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
        + List<CoordinateGroup> readAllCoordinateGroups()
        + void updateCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group)
        + void deleteCoordinateGroup(int id)
        + List<CoordinateGroup> filterByLabel(String label)
    }

    class DatabaseConnection {
        - String host
        - int port
        - String database
        - String user
        - String password
        
        + void connect()
        + void disconnect()
        
        + DatabaseConnection(String host, int port, String database, String user, String password)
    }
}

' Associations

### Explanation of the Class Diagram:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - `CoordinateGroupGUI` represents the Swing-based user interface.
   - Methods correspond to user interactions (e.g., adding, updating, deleting coordinate groups).
   - It interacts with the `ConversionService` class in the Logic Layer.

2. **Logic Layer**:
   - `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates` represent the different types of coordinates with conversion methods.
   - `CoordinateGroup` encapsulates a pair of Cartesian and Polar coordinates along with metadata (id, label).
   - `ConversionService` handles business logic, including CRUD operations for coordinate groups and conversions between coordinate types.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - `CoordinateGroupDAO` is responsible for persisting and retrieving data from the database.
   - `DatabaseConnection` manages the connection to the MySQL database.

4. **Associations**:
   - The GUI interacts with the `ConversionService`, which in turn uses the DAO to access the database.
   - Conversion between coordinate types is handled by the respective classes in the Logic Layer.

This design adheres to the Three-Tier architecture, separating concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability.
