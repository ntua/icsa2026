Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

    - PolarCoordinates polarCoordinates
    + getId(): int
    + getLabel(): String
    + getCartesianCoordinates(): CartesianCoordinates
    + getPolarCoordinates(): PolarCoordinates

  }
}

package "database" {
  interface Database {
    + createCoordinateGroup(CoordinateGroup group, String label): int
    + readAllCoordinateGroups(): List<CoordinateGroup>
    + updateCoordinateGroup(int id, CoordinateGroup group): void
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(int id): void
  }

  class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    // Implementation details for database interaction
  }
}


CoordinateGroupInputView --> CoordinateGroupManager : uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> CoordinateConverter : uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> CoordinateGroup : manages
CoordinateGroup --> CartesianCoordinates : contains
CoordinateGroup --> PolarCoordinates : contains

**Explanation:**



* **Packages:** The diagram is organized into three packages: "frontend", "logic", and "database" to reflect the separation of concerns.

* **Classes:**

    * **Frontend:** `CoordinateGroupInputView` handles user interaction, displaying coordinate groups, getting input, and refreshing the display.
    * **Logic:**
        *  `CoordinateConverter` performs conversions between Cartesian and Polar coordinates.
        * `CoordinateGroupManager` interacts with the database to create, read, update, and delete coordinate groups. It uses `CoordinateConverter` for conversions.
        * `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates` represent the respective coordinate systems as simple data classes.

    * **Database:**  The `Database` interface defines the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the database. The `MySQLDatabase` class implements this interface specifically for MySQL.

* **Associations:**
    * **Uses:** Arrows pointing towards a class indicate "uses" relationships. For example, `CoordinateGroupInputView` uses the `CoordinateGroupManager`.
    * **Contains:**  Arrows with a filled diamond head represent "contains" relationships. A `CoordinateGroup` contains instances of `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates`.
 

* **Database Connection:** The diagram doesn't explicitly show the TCP/IP connection, but it's implied by the `CoordinateGroupManager` using the `Database` interface (which would be implemented with database connection logic).
