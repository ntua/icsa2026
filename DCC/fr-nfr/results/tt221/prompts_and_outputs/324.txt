Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: Three-Tier

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.



Response:
Here's a PlantUML class diagram based on your task description:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Presentation Tier" {
  class Storefront {
    - label : String
    - cartesianCoordinates : CartesianCoordinates
    - polarCoordinates : PolarCoordinates
    + viewCartesian() : void
    + viewPolar() : void
    + addGroup(label: String, cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates, polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates) : void
  }
}

package "Logic Tier" {
  class CoordinateGroupManager {
    - coordinateGroups : List<CoordinateGroup>
    - database : DatabaseConnection
    + createGroup(label: String, cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates, polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates) : CoordinateGroup
    + readGroups() : List<CoordinateGroup>
    + updateGroup(coordinateGroup: CoordinateGroup, newCartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates, newPolarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates) : void
    + deleteGroup(coordinateGroup: CoordinateGroup) : void
  }

  class CoordinateConverter {
    - database : DatabaseConnection
    + cartesianToPolar(cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates) : PolarCoordinates
    + polarToCartesian(polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates) : CartesianCoordinates
  }
}

package "Data Tier" {
  class DatabaseConnection {
    + connect() : void
    + disconnect() : void
    + createRecord(coordinateGroup: CoordinateGroup) : void
    + readRecords() : List<CoordinateGroup>
    + updateRecord(coordinateGroup: CoordinateGroup, newCartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates, newPolarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates) : void
    + deleteRecord(coordinateGroup: CoordinateGroup) : void
  }

  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id : Integer
    - label : String
    - cartesianCoordinates : CartesianCoordinates
    - polarCoordinates : PolarCoordinates
    + getCartesianCoordinates() : CartesianCoordinates
    + getPolarCoordinates() : PolarCoordinates
  }
}

Storefront --> CoordinateGroupManager : Uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> CoordinateConverter : Uses
CoordinateGroupManager --> DatabaseConnection : Accesses
CoordinateConverter --> DatabaseConnection : Accesses

In this class diagram, I have defined the necessary classes based on the provided requirements. The `Presentation Tier` package contains the `Storefront` class which is responsible for user interaction and input/output operations. 

The `Logic Tier` package includes two classes: `CoordinateGroupManager` and `CoordinateConverter`. 
- `CoordinateGroupManager` manages all operations related to coordinate groups such as creation, reading, updating, and deletion. It maintains a list of all stored coordinate groups (`coordinateGroups`) and establishes a connection to the database using the `DatabaseConnection` class.
- `CoordinateConverter` performs conversions between Cartesian and polar coordinates.

The `Data Tier` package contains classes for database operations: 
- `DatabaseConnection` handles communication with the MySQL database server, creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.
- `CoordinateGroup` represents an individual coordinate group, storing its unique identifier (`id`), label, Cartesian coordinates (`cartesianCoordinates`), polar coordinates (`polarCoordinates`). 

The associations between classes are defined using the following notations:
- "Uses" for dependency and usage relationships
- "Accesses" for database access operations.
