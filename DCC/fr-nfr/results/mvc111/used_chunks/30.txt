To further clarify “Model -View -Controller ” architecture, let's explore a specific example . MVC (Model -View -Controller)  architecture example:  
Problem Description:  
A car rental company wants to develop a software system that will enable customers to rent cars online. Customers should be able to browse available cars, select a car to rent, and make a reservation. The 
system should keep track of the availability of cars, as well as the reservations made by customers. Identify Use Cases  
• Browse available cars  
• Select a car to rent  
• Make a reservation  
 
UML class diagram  for above problem with MVC architecture : 
 @startuml  
  class CarRentalView {  
    +displayCar()  
    +displayReservationDetails()  
  } 
 
class CarRentalController {  
    -model: CarRentalModel  
    -view: CarRentalView  
    +searchCars()  
    +reserveCars()  
  } 
   
class CarRentalModel {  
    -customers: List<>  
    -cars: List<>  
    -reservations: List<>  
    +fetchCars()  
    +updateReservationDetails()  
  } 
CarRentalView -- CarRentalController: Request/Response  
CarRentalController --> CarRentalModel : Request Data  
CarRentalModel --> Database : Connection  
@enduml  
 
 
The Model  includes the  Customer , Car, and  Reservation  entities , along with methods for fetching  for cars 
and making reservations. The View  is represented by the CarRentalView, which defines methods for displaying cars and reservation 
details. (Score: 0.9541641229320568)

Software Architecture Patterns and corresponding UML class diagrams  
 
The big picture  
Architectural design  is a process for identifying the sub -systems making up a system and the 
framework for sub -system control and communication. The output of this design process is a 
description of the software architecture. (Score: 1.0758755781140554)

May be management problems if servers are owned by different organizations. To further clarify “ Client -Server ” architecture, let's explore a specific example. Client -Server example:  
Application Description : The Library Management System  is a desktop application for librarians, 
enabling them to manage book collections, user information, and borrowing transactions. Operating 
with a thick client architecture, the application handles all business logic locally, while a server 
database stores and retrieves data. Functional Requirements  
1. Book Management : Add, update, and delete book records, including details such as title, 
author, ISBN, and availability status. 2. User Management : Register new users, update user information, and manage user records. 3. Transaction Management : Facilitate book borrowing and returning, tracking user and book 
details for each transaction. 4. Data Storage : Store and retrieve all book, user, and transaction data in a centralized server 
database. Class diagram in plantUML of the application with client -server architecture pattern:  
@startuml  
package "Client" {  
    class LibraryApp {  
      - bookManager: BookManager  
      - userManager: UserManager  
      - transactionManager: TransactionManager  
      + run()   (Score: 1.1090822815282513)

Different users have different needs for how they want to view the program.s 
information. The system needs to reflect data changes to all users in the way t hat they want to view 
them, while making it easy to make changes to the user interface. Solution description : This involves separating the data being manipulated from the manipulation 
logic and the details of display using three components: Model (a problem -domain component with 
data and operations, independent of the user interface), View (a data display componen t), and 
Controller (a component that receives and acts on user input). Consequences : Advantages: views and controllers can be easily be added, removed, or changed; 
views can be added or changed during execution; user interface components can be changed, even 
at runtime. Disadvantages: views and controller are often hard to separate; freque nt updates may 
slow data display and degrade user interface performance; the MVC style makes user interface 
components (views, controllers) highly dependent on model components.  (Score: 1.161612226590504)

Model -View -Controller  
• Serves as a basis of interaction management in many web -based systems. • Decouples three major interconnected components:  
o The model  is the central component of the pattern that directly manages the 
data, logic and rules of the application. It is the application's dynamic data 
structure, independent of the user interface. o A view  can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a 
diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible. o The controller  accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view. • Supported by most language frameworks. Controller: Maps user actions to model updates. Selects View ( Controller --> Model  :State Change, 
Controller --> View :  View Selection ) 
View: Renders model, Requests model updates, Sends user events to controller (View  --> Controller  : 
User events, View  --> Model : State query)  
Model: Encapsulates application state, Notifies view of state changes. (Model  --> View  : Change 
Notification)  
 
Overview of  Model -View -Controller (MVC)  pattern : 
Description : Separates presentation and interaction from the system data. The system is structured 
into three logical components that interact with each other. The Model component manages the 
system data and associated operations on that data. The View component define s and manages how 
the data is presented to the user. The Controller component manages user interaction (e.g., key 
presses, mouse clicks, etc.) and passes these interactions to the View and the Model. Problem description : The display presented to the user frequently changes over time in response to 
input or computation. (Score: 1.1766055527061785)
