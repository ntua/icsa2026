Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: MVC(Model-View-Controller)

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

    + modifyCoordinateGroup(id: int, label: String, coordinates: (double, double))

DCCController "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : manages


CoordinateGroupView "1" -- "1" DCCController : uses

DatabaseConnector "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : persists

**Explanation:**



* **Packages:** The diagram is divided into four packages: `Model`, `View`, `Controller`, and `Database`. This separation reflects the MVC architecture.
* **Classes:** Each package contains relevant classes.
    * **Model:** Holds the core data structure (`CoordinateGroup`) and coordinate representations (`CartesianCoordinate`, `PolarCoordinate`).
    * **View:**  Represents the user interface elements (`CoordinateGroupView`) responsible for displaying information and collecting input. 
    * **Controller:** The brain of the application (`DCCController`), handling logic, user interactions, and communication with the Model and Database.
    * **Database:** Contains the class (`DatabaseConnector`) responsible for interacting with the MySQL database to store and retrieve coordinate groups.

* **Associations:**
    * `DCCController "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : manages`: The Controller creates, modifies, and deletes CoordinateGroups.
    * `CoordinateGroupView "1" -- "1" DCCController : uses`: The View interacts with the Controller to display data and receive user input.
    * `DatabaseConnector "1" -- "*" CoordinateGroup : persists`: The Database Connector handles saving and retrieving CoordinateGroups from the MySQL database.

**Key Points:**

* This diagram focuses on the core classes and relationships for the DCC Application.
* You can expand this diagram by adding more specific methods, attributes, or error handling logic as needed.
