Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: MVC(Model-View-Controller)

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

```plantuml

package "Model" {

  class CoordinateGroup {
    - id: int
    - label: String
    - timestamp: Date
    - cartesianCoordinates: CartesianCoordinates
    - polarCoordinates: PolarCoordinates

    + convertCartesianToPolar()
    + convertPolarToCartesian()
  }

  class CartesianCoordinates {
    - x: double
    - y: double
  }

  class PolarCoordinates {
    - radius: double
    - angle: double 
  }
}

package "View" {

  class DCCView {
    + displayCoordinateGroups()
    + getCoordinateInput()
    + displayConversionResults()
    + showErrorMessage(message: String)
  }
}

package "Controller" {

  class DCCController {
    - model: Model.CoordinateGroup
    - view: View.DCCView

    + createCoordinateGroup(coordinates: Coordinates, label: String)
    + storeCoordinateGroup(group: Model.CoordinateGroup)
    + retrieveCoordinateGroups(label: String): List<Model.CoordinateGroup>
    + modifyCoordinateGroup(id: int, updatedCoordinates: Coordinates, updatedLabel: String)
    + deleteCoordinateGroup(id: int)
  }

}


DCCController "1" -- "*" Model.CoordinateGroup : manages
DCCView "1" -- "1" DCCController : interacts with

**Explanation:**

* **Model:** This package encapsulates the data and business logic of the application:
    * `CoordinateGroup`: Represents a group of coordinates (Cartesian or Polar) with ID, label, timestamp, and conversion methods.
    * `CartesianCoordinates` and `PolarCoordinates`: Classes to store Cartesian (x, y) and Polar (radius, angle) coordinates respectively.

* **View:** This package handles the user interface:
    * `DCCView`: Responsible for displaying coordinate groups, taking input from users, showing conversion results, and displaying error messages. 

* **Controller:** This package acts as an intermediary between the Model and View:
    * `DCCController`: Manages interactions with the database (using a library like JDBC), handles user actions, updates the Model, and instructs the View to display information.


**Associations:**

* The diagram shows a "1" to "*" association between `DCCController` and `CoordinateGroup`, indicating that one controller instance can manage multiple coordinate groups.
* There's also a "1" to "1" association between `DCCView` and `DCCController`, signifying their close interaction for user interface management.
