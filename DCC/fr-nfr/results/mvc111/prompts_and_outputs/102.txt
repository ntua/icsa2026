Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: MVC(Model-View-Controller)

Functional Requirements: 
1. Coordinate Group Creation:
    - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    - Input one type of coordinate (either Cartesian or polar), and the software should handle the conversion to the other type.
    - A coordinate group consists of:
      - Cartesian: (x, y)
      - Polar: (r, θ)

2. Coordinate Group Storing:
    - Store coordinate groups in a MySQL database with the following attributes:
      - Unique auto-generated identifier (integer).
      - User-defined string label for identification.
      - Automatically assigned timestamp.

3. Coordinate Group Retrieval:
    - Retrieve coordinate groups either by:
      - Label: Search using a user-defined string label.
      - View all: Retrieve and display all saved coordinate groups.

4. Coordinate Group Modification:
    - Select and modify details of a coordinate group (Cartesian or polar values, label) and save the updated version.

5. Coordinate Group Deletion:
    - Delete a coordinate group from the database.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: Developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction.
- Database: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups.
- TCP/IP Connection: To handle the communication between the application and the database.

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

DCCController --> DCCView: Request/Response

DCCController --> CoordinateModel: Data Access

**Explanation:**



* **Packages:** The diagram is organized into packages ("Model", "View", and "Controller") to reflect the MVC architecture. 
* **Classes:** Each class represents a distinct entity or concept within the DCC Application.
    * **CoordinateGroup:** Represents a group of coordinates with attributes for id, label, timestamp, cartesianCoordinates (object), and polarCoordinates (object). Methods are included for conversion between coordinate types.
    * **CartesianCoordinate** and **PolarCoordinate**: Represent individual Cartesian and Polar coordinate points, respectively.
    * **DCCView**: Responsible for displaying information to the user, handling input events from the UI (Swing framework). 
    * **DCCController:** Acts as an intermediary between the View and Model, receiving requests from the View, processing them, and interacting with the Model.
    * **CoordinateModel**: Handles data access and persistence through interaction with the MySQL database. It includes methods for saving, retrieving, modifying, and deleting coordinate groups.

* **Associations:**
    * **DCCController --> DCCView:** Represents a Request/Response relationship where the Controller responds to requests from the View (e.g., displaying coordinate groups, handling creation or modification forms).
    * **DCCController --> CoordinateModel:** Indicates Data Access, where the Controller interacts with the Model to retrieve, save, update, and delete coordinate groups from the database.

**Key Points:**



* The diagram follows MVC principles: the Model manages data, the View displays information, and the Controller handles interactions between them.
* Classes have appropriate attributes (data members) and methods (operations).
* Associations are clearly depicted to show how classes interact.
