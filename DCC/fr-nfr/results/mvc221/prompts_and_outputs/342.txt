Question:
Task Description:
You are tasked with processing a software description and its requirements to generate a class diagram using PlantUML. 
The class diagram should respect the requested software architecture, define all necessary classes, and accurately represent associations between them.

Overview:

The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application is a software system that manages coordinate groups in both Cartesian and polar formats. 
The system allows users to convert, store, retrieve, modify, and delete coordinate groups. 

Software Architecture: MVC(Model-View-Controller)

Functional Requirements: 
1. Logic
1.1 Define cartesian coordinates as a pair (x, y) of high-precision numbers
1.2 Define polar coordinates as a pair (r, θ) of high-precision numbers
1.3 Convert cartesian (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates
1.4 Convert polar (r, θ) to cartesian (x, y) coordinates
1.5 A coordinate group contains cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates

2. Data operations
2.1 CreateOp: create a unique auto-generated integer identifier (id) for the coordinate group edited, add a timestamp, and save the label and the values of the coordinates group as a new record into the database
2.2 ReadOp: Create a list of all saved coordinate group records. For each record, show: id, label, cartesian coordinate values, polar coordinate values, datetime added or modified), sorted by id
2.3 UpdateOp: Update a coordinate group record with new values entered by the user and save the updated record of the coordinates group into the database
2.4 DeleteOp: Delete a coordinate group record from the database
 
3. User interactions
3.1 Input one new coordinate group and one string to label the group
3.2 When the user inputs cartesian coordinates (x, y), calculate the corresponding polar (r, θ) coordinates by converting cartesian to polar
3.3 When the user inputs polar coordinates (r, θ), calculate the corresponding cartesian coordinates by converting polar to cartesian
3.4 When "add" is selected, execute CreateOp for the current values of the coordinate group and the label
3.5 When "update" is selected, execute the UpdateOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp
3.6 When "delete" is selected, execute the DeleteOp for the selected record in the list created by the ReadOp 
3.7 When initializing and when "add", "update" or "delete" is executed, refresh and display the list created by the ReadOp
3.8 Filter the list of coordinate groups displayed, by a label value entered by the user
3.9 Clear the active filter and display all saved coordinate group records, as in 3.7

Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Frontend: To be developed using Java with the Swing framework for user interaction
- Logic: To be developed using Java classes, according to the object-oriented design principles
- Database server: MySQL for persistent storage of coordinate groups
- Database connection: TCP/IP connection for the communication between the application and the database
- Design: Apply the "Single Responsibility Principle"

Generate a class diagram using PlantUML that defines all necessary classes and associations based on the described architecture, requirements, and functionality. Ensure that:
- The diagram reflects the separation of concerns based on the requested architecture.
- Each class is properly defined with attributes and methods.
- All associations (e.g., composition, aggregation, or inheritance) between the classes are included in plantUML and are clearly represented. 
- Create the appropriate packages to include the classes.

**Explanation:**



* **Packages:** The diagram is organized into packages ("frontend," "controller", "model", "database") for better structure and maintainability.
* **Classes:** Each class represents a distinct entity or concept in the application. Their attributes (data members) and methods are defined, reflecting their responsibilities.

    *  **DCCView:** Handles user interaction through Swing framework.
    *  **DCCController:** Manages communication between the view and the model, processing user input and invoking appropriate model operations.
    *  **DCCModel:** Represents the application logic and data. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve coordinate groups.

    * **CoordinateGroup:** Encapsulates data for a single coordinate group (Cartesian and Polar coordinates).

    * **CartesianCoordinates, PolarCoordinates:** Represent coordinate types with conversion methods between them.
    * **MySQLDatabase:** Handles database interactions.


* **Associations:**

   *  **"1" -- "*"**: Indicates a one-to-many relationship. For example, the DCCController uses one DCCModel instance, while a DCCModel might manage multiple CoordinateGroup instances.
   * **Composition ("o"):** Represents a "has-a" relationship. The DCCView is composed of GUI elements (not explicitly shown).

**Key Points:**



* **Single Responsibility Principle:**  Each class has a specific and focused responsibility: the view handles input/output, the controller mediates between the view and model, the model manages data logic, and database classes handle persistence.
* **Flexibility:** This design allows for easy modification and extension. For example, you could change the database implementation by creating a new class that implements the same interface as MySQLDatabase.
